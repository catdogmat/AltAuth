## Description
This all started when chat reporting was added, I don't think many people liked it at all. New mods and plugins came out, removing/blocking chat reporting but there needs to be a system independent from Microsoft. That's where AltAuth comes in, it allows you to join Minecraft servers without contacting Microsoft servers (and no the servers don't need to be cracked).
